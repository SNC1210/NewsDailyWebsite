                    clear that both its catastrophic toll on human life and the severe socioeconomic dislocation it has
                    caused matter equally. Yet there is growing inequality associated with governments’ and private
                    citizens’ responses to the pandemic regarding access to vaccines and policies to support vulnerable
                    groups. In this context, Professor Branko Milanovic of the Stone Center on Socio Economic Inequality
                    at the City University of New York, and former lead economist in the World Bank’s Research
                    Department for almost 20 years, shared with Narayan Lakshman his perspective on the relationship
                    between inequality and different forms of capitalism across the world.</p>
